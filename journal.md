Technology has helped people in many ways, even in some where the task seemed impossible. Even in the food industry technology has helped it grow. For example, it has helped farmers grow more food with less effort over all. It does come with its risks though. For example, the risk of cyberattack, environmental harm, exploitation of workers and a widening of the gap between commercial and subsistence farmers are just some examples of problems that it may cause.

As more and more tech industries are shifting to AI tools and help over skilled people, I think this shift possibly is a good change, but at the same time i think it's not a good change, because yes, AI is capable of doing jobs better than a person but it still has its limits and there are some things AI just can't do better than a huamn. I personally think the shift to AI would just drop jobs and cause problems for others.

With the banning of Tik Tok due to security reasons is what the Government states. I think the government intervention into tik tok and now other possible chinese companies in america would be a bad decision. Especially in the video game genre, millions of Americans play video games owned by chinese companies and banning them would cause massive back lash. I think companies like Tik Tok should come forward with if the app is a security issue or not, because it can benefit it on the long term. A lesson i could take from this situation is to make sure my projects are secure, and not involved with china.
