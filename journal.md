Exactly following intrusctions while learning how to code is important. The main reason is because computers don't understand language like us,

AI is a useful tool that is widely available nowadays. Although they're some pros and cons of using AI. For example, AI can be used to look up useful information as it pulls from thousands of different sources to show a summary of the topic its looking for. A con is that students can use it to cheat on their tests, exams, and essays.

Technology has helped people in many ways, even in some where the task seemed impossible. Even in the food industry technology has helped it grow. For example, it has helped farmers grow more food with less effort over all. It does come with its risks though. For example, the risk of cyberattack, environmental harm, exploitation of workers and a widening of the gap between commercial and subsistence farmers are just some examples of problems that it may cause.

1. I mostly enjoyed learning how to build video games and how to build them.
2. I'd like to slowly build my own interactive pvp video game with cool magic abilities.

As more and more tech industries are shifting to AI tools and help over skilled people, I think this shift possibly is a good change, but at the same time i think it's not a good change, because yes, AI is capable of doing jobs better than a person but it still has its limits and there are some things AI just can't do better than a huamn. I personally think the shift to AI would just drop jobs and cause problems for others.

With the banning of Tik Tok due to security reasons is what the Government states. I think the government intervention into tik tok and now other possible chinese companies in america would be a bad decision. Especially in the video game genre, millions of Americans play video games owned by chinese companies and banning them would cause massive back lash. I think companies like Tik Tok should come forward with if the app is a security issue or not, because it can benefit it on the long term. A lesson i could take from this situation is to make sure my projects are secure, and not involved with china.

While this crash that happened on the 29, a lot of factors that involve technology could have been at fault for the accident. One reason could be the Air trafic control system. The Air Trafic Control System allows for planes to take certain routes without getting in the way of other ongoing planes. A malfunction to this system can possibly make the flight harder, due to the lack of knowledge of where other aircrafts could be flying.

For example, after I finished cleaning the house and the kicthen I was able to relax and watch TV while gaming on my phone. I usually woud play video games like brawl stars, roblox, and watched anime on crunchyroll. All this technology helped me stay entertained during the break, since they all carried things that interested me.

Something I learned last week was that certain animals that live in the northern parts  of canada can live their whole lives without having ever tasted a drop of water. They get the water they need from eating the nuts and berries they find while gathering food.

I personally think teaching slang isn't nesessary, because nowadays people already change words and their meaning or abreviate them in any way possible. As cultures evolve I think its best for people to do their own investigating on the matter.
